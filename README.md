**Don't do evil.**

## Getting started

First of all, open the **settings.example.py** file, add an Gmail address and its password to it, also add an destination Email address to receive the QR code image. If necessary, remember to change the default path.

Then, change the name to ***settings.py*** 

After that, run ***main.py***. Remember to use Python 3. Don't ask why, because Python 2.x sucks!

Wait for a while and you will receive an image with QR code on it. Open it and scan it with WeChat account which needs to be monitored.

Then after you log in, just wait and get your result. ðŸ˜‚
